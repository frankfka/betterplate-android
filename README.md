# Betterplate - Android

Betterplate is a nutritional tracking app for popular restaurants and fast food destinations. A demo video can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOXGw07Vfe4).

As a fitness enthusiast and stickler for healthy eating, I wanted to easily access nutritional information of restaurant menu items. However, I could not find an existing solution that integrated nutritional details of a variety of restaurants. I have always had an interest in developing mobile applications, so I decided to build this app myself.

This app was built using Java in Android Studio. It was one of my first projects in Android development.
